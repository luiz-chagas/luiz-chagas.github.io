  Hi! I'm a software developer with a background in Computer Science and about 7 years of experience.

  I currently work with full stack development, mainly with <mark>JavaScript</mark> technologies.

  I'm very proficient with <mark>React</mark>, <mark>Typescript</mark>, <mark>Node.js</mark>, <mark>(No)Sql Databases</mark>, API integrations and other things.

  Most of my recent work revolves around building applications with great User Experience while keeping code quality to the best I can (readable, tested, self-documented and simple).

  <mark>Functional Programming</mark> is my jam.

          Vera is care management app for plants that makes tracking as fun as the care itself, so anyone can be a successful plant parent.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I worked on building Vera from scratch. We were a team of 4 people (1 designer, 2 devs, 1 marketing) and we built the first version of the app in only 16 days. 
          Vera was a hit on both App Store and Play Store reaching over 200k users in under a year. The application now belongs to Bloomscape.

          The main technologies used were <mark>React-Native</mark> and <mark>Google Firebase</mark>.

          I wrote my own roboadvisor to trade stocks using Robinhood. As a by-product I built `stock-info`, a utility that retrieves current stock information from Yahoo's Finance API.

          The library runs on node and is exported as an open source package on NPM, being used in over 50 projects on GitHub.

      I love soccer, games (computer/board/etc), my family, grilling and beer. üçª

      I also like to dig deep into programming and study topics of my interest, you may
