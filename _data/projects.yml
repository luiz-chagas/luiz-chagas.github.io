    I worked on developing Vera from scratch. We were a team of 4 people (1 designer, 2 devs, 1 marketing) and we built the first version of the app in only 16 days. 
    Vera was a hit on both App Store and Play Store, being downloaded over a thousand times on its first month.
    If you have plants and often forget to water them, this app is for you!
    The main technologies used were <mark>React-Native</mark> and <mark>Google Firebase</mark>.
