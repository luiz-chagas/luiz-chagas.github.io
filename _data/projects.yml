    I worked on building Vera from scratch. We were a team of 4 people (1 designer, 2 devs, 1 marketing) and we built the first version of the app in only 16 days. 
    Vera was a hit on both App Store and Play Store reaching over 200k users in under a year. The application now belongs to Bloomscape.

    The main technologies used were <mark>React-Native</mark> and <mark>Google Firebase</mark>.

    At some point I decided to make my own roboadvisor to trade stocks using Robinhood. As a by-product I built `stock-info`, a utility that retrieves current stock information from Yahoo's Finance API.

    The library runs on node and is exported as an open source package on NPM.
